# DANUBIUS-RI Modelling Node Working Group 2 Hackathon

Welcome to the [DANUBIUS-RI](https://www.danubius-ri.eu/) Modelling Node Working Group 2 Hackathon! 

This hackathon is part of the **Working Group 2 Workshop** on **Standardisation of model results in River-Sea Systems**. For more information about the workshop please see: https://www.danubius-ri.eu/upcoming_events.html

## Hackathon objective:
The objective of the hackathon is for the River-Sea Systems modelling community to **develop tools to write model output data to a common UGRID netcdf data standard**.

As a starting point for your developments, two python scripts that write unstructured model output to the UGRID netcdf data standard are provided: \
https://github.com/openearth/danubius-modelling-node-hackaton/tree/main/scripts/python \
For additional documentation about the python scripts, please see: \
https://github.com/openearth/danubius-modelling-node-hackaton/blob/main/scripts/python/doc/danubius-modelling-node-ugrid.pdf

## How this hackathon will be run
1. The hackathon activity will be launched at the **Working Group 2 Workshop** on **Standardisation of model results in River-Sea Systems** on Monday 7 June 2021. 
2. Hackathon participants will work on their developments as **_homework_**. The above python scripts can be used as a starting point or for inspiration.
3. In September 2021 (exact dates to be confirmed) a dedicated 1 or 2 day (online) hackathon will be hosted for the community to get together and jointly work on their developments.
4. In December 2021 another DANUBIUS-RI Modelling Node online event will be held, and part of the agenda for that event is for the various River-Sea System modelling communities participating in the hackathon to present the outcome of their work.

### Support during the _homework_ phase
We have enabled **_[Discussions](https://github.com/openearth/danubius-modelling-node-hackaton/discussions)_** in this repository. **_Discussions_** will be the primary mechanism through which the community will engage and collaborate with each other during the **_homework_** phase of the hackathon.

The [discussion forum](https://github.com/openearth/danubius-modelling-node-hackaton/discussions) is a place for you to mingle with your peers, discuss technical issues, ask questions, collaborate and share ideas. Treat it as your own, and help cultivate a healthy, diverse ecosystem. Discussions can be open-ended, and is best when there is a sincere exchange of opinions. 

We encourage questions. To ask questions, please go to the [discussions](https://github.com/openearth/danubius-modelling-node-hackaton/discussions) tab and click on `New discussion`. Under `Select Category`, select `Q&A`, provide a human readable title and ask your question and click `Start discussion`. 

We value being welcoming and courteous. Our [discussion guidelines](https://github.com/openearth/danubius-modelling-node-hackaton/blob/main/discussion_guidelines.md) describe what is considered good practice and encourage positive behaviour and we ask that you adhere to our guidelines. Please introduce yourself in the [welcome post](https://github.com/openearth/danubius-modelling-node-hackaton/discussions/1).
